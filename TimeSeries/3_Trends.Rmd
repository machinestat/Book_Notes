In general time series, the mean function is a totally arbitrary function of time. In a stationary time series, the mean function must be constant in time. Frequently, we need to consider mean functions that are relatively simple (but not constant) functions of time.

## 3.1 Deterministic Versus Stochastic Trends

The random walk process has zero mean for all time therefore different simulation of the same process might well show completely different "trends". Such trends are so called **stochastic trends**. 

The average monthly temperature series shows a cyclical or seasonal trend, but here the reason for the trend is clear. In this case the possible model might be $Y_{t} = \mu_{t} + X_{t}$, where $\mu_{t}$ is a deterministic function that is periodic with period 12; that is $\mu_{t}$, should satisfy 
$$
\mu_{t} = \mu_{t} - 12 \ \ \text{for all} \ \ t
$$

We might assume that $X_{t}$, the unobserved variation around $\mu_{t}$, has zero mean for all $t$ so that indeed $\mu_{t}$ is the mean function for the observed series $Y_{t}$. This is a **deterministic trend**. An implication of the model $Y_{t} = \mu_{t} + X_{t}$ with $E(X_{t}) = 0$ for all $t$ is that the deterministic trend $\mu_{t}$ applies for all time. Thus, if $\mu_{t} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}t$, we are assuming the *same* linear time trend applies forever.

## 3.2 Estimation of a Constant Mean

Consider the simple situation where a constant mean function is asummed

$$
Y_{t} = \mu + X_{t}  \   \text{(3.2.1)}
$$

where $E(X_{t}) = 0$ for all $t$. We wish to estimate $\mu$ with observed time series $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \cdots, Y_{n}$. The most common estimate of $\mu$ is the sample mean or average defined as
$$
\bar{Y_{t}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t = 1}^{n} Y_{t} \ \ \text{(3.2.2)}
$$

Under the minimal assumptions of Equation (3.2.1), we see that $E(\bar{Y}) = \mu$; therefore $\bar{Y}$ is an unbiased estimate of $\mu$. 

Suppose that $Y_{t}$ is a stationary time series with autocorrelation function $\rho_{k}$. Then, by Excercise 2.17

$$ 
\begin{aligned}
Var\left( \bar{Y} \right) &= \frac{\gamma_{0}}{n}\left[ \sum_{k=-n+1}^{n-1} \left( 1 - \frac{\left | k \right |}{n} \right) \rho_{k} \right] \\
                          &= \frac{\gamma_{0}}{n} \left[ 1 + 2\sum_{k = 1}^{n - 1} \left( 1 - \frac{k}{n} \right) \rho_{k} \right] \  \ \text{(3.2.3)}
\end{aligned}
$$
